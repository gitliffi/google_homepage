Project Goal:
Building the Google Homepage from scratch
Thoughts: (Pre-project)
Hopefully using the developer tools to breakdown the google homepage
and understand how elements come together in html.
Did the freeCodeCamp projects using CodePen but this seems much more "real"

Thoughts:(Post-Project)
Wow this took much longer than I expected and was a little tougher than what I imagined. Although it is not as responsive as Google's homepage, I'm pretty proud of what I've made. 

Learning Points:
- W3schools Google Icons has a lot of icons to be used
- Creating headers/footers/navbars benefit from using flex to center/ align the items
    - text-decoration: none is also useful to remove the decorations from the list
- Nested divisions, using a div container is useful to organise elements in blocks, however, important to note the behaviour of divs within divs and how styles can be affected eg Collapsible Margins which created some white space at the top and bottom of the page despite the "viewport" element spanning the height and width of the page. This was solved with placing overflow:hidden. w3schools defines overflow as specifying what happen if content overflows an element box, decides to clip(hidden) or add scrollbars(scroll).
-Webdev tools are also really helpful and taking a look at the Google homepage as well as some student solutions proved to be helpful in understanding how it worked.
